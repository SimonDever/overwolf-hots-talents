Planned features for the future, in no particular order, with notes.

### Draft helpers

- **Player search/lookup from Hotslogs.** If we can display the most relevant info about players this would be nice to save some ALT+TABs.
- **Counter picks.** Every bit of info helps. But where to get the data? Crowdsourced? Some hotslogs chart?

### Quality of Life improvements

- **Automatic replay upload to Hotslogs.** Lot's of questions, but a requested feature and seems to be a good idea. 
- **Better team composition page.** More data, better images, better UI.
- **Analytics, error reporting.** More important for me, helps to know what is going on with the app.

### New features

- **Share/save your talent builds.** Suggested by [Zweer](https://github.com/Zweer). Needs fleshing out.
- **LED API integration.** On some Logitech keyboards. Not important, but the API is now in Overwolf, so why not? 
- **Historical data display.** Charts. Beautiful charts. Everyone loves chart. Especially pies.
